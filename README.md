# The Caesar Cipher code is a Python program that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher method. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This code provides a simple and efficient way to apply the Caesar cipher and retrieve the original message, with the added feature of language options for the user interface and the text.

# Features
# - Encrypts messages by shifting each letter in the plaintext a specified number of positions down the alphabet.
# - Decrypts messages by shifting each letter in the ciphertext a specified number of positions up the alphabet.
# - Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
# - Supports custom shift values.
# - Provides input validation to ensure the entered message and shift value are valid.
# - Allows users to choose the language of the user interface ( English, Russian).
# - Allows users to choose the language of the text to be encrypted or decrypted.
